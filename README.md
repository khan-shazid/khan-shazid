  I am a Super-motivated software engineer with a passion for solving real life problems with code. I've been in the game since late 2017, and my journey has taken me through diverse experiences.

In my current role as a Software Engineer at Scopic Software, I'm working with various technologies which includes React, Typescript, Redux, LG WebOS, RTK Query. Apart from building reusable and optimized components for apps, I am also involved in writing Unit Tests, Reviewing Codes, Managing Feature Development and Staging Deployments, Analyzing Requirements and Creating Tasks Based on That and so on.

Before this adventure, I had an exciting journey at Japan Travel KK as a Full Stack Developer. I have worked on one of their products named <a href="https://sso.toursoft.systems/" target="_blank">Toursoft</a>. This was a great experience for me as I had the opportunity to work on most of the core features eg. Enquiry Module, Itinerary Builder, Quotation Builder, Booking Module. This is a SaaS product and a multi tenant architecture based solution. I had the opportunity to work with different aspects of Software development which included - Analyzing Requirements, Planning & Impact Assessment, Technical Design, Development, Writing Feature Test, PR Review, Merging PRs, Deploy on Staging, QA Testing, Deploy to Tenants. I have experience working with each aspects and also documentation and Project Management aspects.</p>

I've honed my skills in PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node JS, Next Js, Laravel, React, React Native and more. Whether it's full-stack development or others, I'm all about ensuring projects are on track and solving challenges. I'm a continuous learner, always exploring new avenues through self-study and hands-on experience.
